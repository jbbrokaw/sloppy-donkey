# **SLOPPY DONKEY**

##Seattle's Premier Concert Venue

*Why does this company want a web site?*

The Sloppy Donkey is a music venue with a bar. The website will provide:

*A calendar of upcoming events, with ticket purchase option.
*A booking form for potential live acts to fill said calendar
*Info (location, hours, drink specials, etc.)

*Why that answer?*

Patrons need to know, bands need to book/promote, drinkers gotta drink, haters gonna hate.

*What's the deeper why?*

**Profit.**
